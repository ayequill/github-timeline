# GitHub Timeline

API's and graphical representation of information are hallmarks of modern
web applications. GitHub Timeline combines the two to create a visual history
of a users GitHub activity.

The goal of GitHup Timeline is accept a GitHub user name and produce a
timeline containing each repo and annotated with the repo names, the date
they were created, and their descriptions. The timeline should be one that
could be shared with a prospective employer. It should be easy to read and
make effective use of color and typography.

Only public GitHub repos should be displayed.
